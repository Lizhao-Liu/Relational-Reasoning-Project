# Incorporating Relational Reasoning into Neural Network

A dissertation submitted to the University of Bristol in accordance with the requirements of the degree of Master of Science in the Faculty of Engineering.


## Abstract

This project aims to incorporate relational reasoning ability into a neural network to handle visual reasoning tasks inspired by the RFT ideas. To this end, this project adopted the Relation Networks as the base reasoning module with itsâ€™ relation-centric design and superb relational reasoning ability. Our neural network model is tested with the Natural Language for Visual Reasoning dataset, which requires the model to reason out the spatial, quantitative, or comparative relations between the shapes from the visual inputs. Due to the scalability problem and the task complexity limitation of the basic model, we also implemented an enhanced version model that combined an attention mechanism and a double-layer design. Our model finally achieves 55.7% accuracy for the first version and 60.7% accuracy for the enhanced version, which achieves a comparably high performance according to the leaderboard on the ocial NLVR website, which contributes to the development of enabling AI to simulate human brain underlying process in cognition building and language learning.
